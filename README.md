**Efficiently automate test cases in Dynamics NAV and Business Central**

## What is this book about?
Dynamics 365 Business Central is the new cloud-based SaaS ERP proposition from Microsoft. It’s not as simple as it used to be way back when it was called Navigator, Navision Financials, or Microsoft Business Solutions-Navision. Our development practices are becoming more formal, and with this, the call for test automation is pressing on us.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Understand what automated tests are, and when and why to use them
* Explore the five pillars of the Testability Framework of Business Central
* Design and write automated tests for Business Central
* Make use of standard automated tests and their helper libraries
* Integrate automated tests into your development practice
